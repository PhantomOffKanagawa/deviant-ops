> *Inject a little joy into your code reviews!*  
> A GitHub Action that unleashes an evil LLM overlord to judge your PRs — and deny the joyless.

Feel like your code reviews are a bit too... *drab?*  
Looking to add that ✨ *je ne sais quoi* ✨ to your PRs?    

DeviantOps is a GitHub Action that only lets PRs into your protected branches if they are:

- 😈 Cheery
- ✨ Filled with emojis
- 😎 Stylistically top notch
- 👁️ With an optional focus of your most beige coders

### ⚙️ What It Does

- Scans pull requests for **comment joy**, **vibes**, and **EMOJIS**
- Uses an 🤖 LLM (currently GPT-4o) to evaluate your code's ✨joyfulness✨
- Blocks merge if the code isn't fabulous 💅 or fun enough
- Posts a perfectly 🧐 passive-aggressive PR comment
- Re-checks new commits until your code is *just right* 🧑‍🍳🤌💋

---

### 🔒 Features

- ✅ Enforces chaotic good (or lawful evil) codebases
- 🔁 Re-evaluates every time you push to the PR
- 🕵️ Secretly lets your natural sparklers bypass the check
- 🗣️ Adds a comment explaining why it passed or failed

---

### 🚀 Setup

1. Copy `.github/workflows/llm-review.yml` into your repo
2. Add your OpenAI API key to repository secrets as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Optionally set protected branches to require status checks
4. Sit back and let the action gaslight, gatekeep, and roboss your PRs

### ✨ Sample Response

This is just an absolute *gem* 💎 of a PR:

### 👻 License

MIT. Do with it what you will. But remember: the bot. is always. *judging*.
